<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

## food App 0.1
Welcome ðŸ‘‹ This repo is a showcase of an android application which uses Clean Architecture and manages states using a FSM(Finite state machine)

### Built With

* [Clean Arch](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
* [RxJava3](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
* [MVVM](https://bit.ly/2GmZICu)

### Architecture

![Arch](images/arch.png)

#### Keywords
* Screen - Represents a layer to react to State presented by domain layer for UI to show or update UI elements
* State - State representation of a finite system based on business logic
* Event - Event representation for UI layer to react to in a finite approach.

## Dependencies

All the dependencies (external libraries) are defined in the single place - Gradle [dependencies.gradle](dependencies.gradle) folder. This approach allows to easily manage dependencies and use the same dependency version across all modules.
